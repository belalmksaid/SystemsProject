Data structures:
	cell: contains the original data and converted data at a certain cell in the table
	datarow: contains a row of cells and the number of cells
	table: contains an array of rows

Process:
	Read cvs file-> mergesort -> output sorted data

Read csv file:
	input is read line by line and each line is processed by split_by_comma() which split the string into an array of strings
	then the array of strings is processed by get_cells() to return an array of cells to create a datarow
	cells that match the index of the of header we're sorting by get converted to the datatype

mergesort:


output:
	we go through the output of the sorted datarows and pring the original, unmodified data using printf
